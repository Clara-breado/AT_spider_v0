      "review": "Having been waiting for such a long time to see Kinky Boots, I was really excited when my boyfriend got tickets for my birthday and really good ones at that.The theatre itself is small and that is expected in central London but the heat was unbearable, I\u2019m not someone who complains about being too warm but even I couldn\u2019t cope and when we asked were told that it would not be turned down.The performance itself was embarrassing and insulting. Being from Northampton I didn\u2019t realise it had been relocated to the far north of the country - if accents must be used at least get them accurate but worst was the acting and singing. Cats screeching came to mind and cheesy looks to audience is not what I have come to expect from West End musicals.We left at the interval along with many others and I would not recommend."

      "review": "I am lucky in that we go to the theatre a lot.  This show is the best I have ever sat and watched.  The music is fantastic , the costumes are amazing and the dancers are incredible.  We went on Christmas Eve and the atmosphere in the theatre was electric.  I cannot go back to see it again and again.  The relationship between the main actors works so well.  Thank you for a fantastic afternoon and making the start to our christmas break."

      "review": "The cast and especially the Drag Queens really go for this.I thought it was a great show, good music, but not any songs that really stick with you.It had some laughs, some good stage effects and a cracking finish.Overall well worth seeing.Started dead on time 7.30pm, interval at 8.45pm for 15 minutes, finished at 10pm.We were in the Royal Circle at the front, but you need to be careful of the seats you get because there are some restricted views. It was also fairly hot in there.Theatre seems a bit tired and drinks a bit expensive.(\u00a32.50 for a small bottled water)"

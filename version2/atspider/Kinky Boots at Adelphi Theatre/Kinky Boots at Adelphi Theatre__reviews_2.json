Luckily though, the show drew you in so much that you didnt notice lack of space until the interval.The facilities at the thetre were very modern, but could have done with more regular checks and refills."

' Charles ' had a great voice and ' Lola ' was fun and sassy.The Queens were amazing and looked great, and the end scene had everyone up and clapping. Would definitely recommend ."

      "review": "A group of us went to see this show and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We knew the story and felt it was close to the original. The costumes were amazing and how they all danced in heels I don\u2019t know. We are part of a theatre company and felt the set was cleverly done and scene changes were seamless. It\u2019s the only show we have ever said if it goes on tour and comes to our local theatre we would  go and see it again. The only criticism and it\u2019s a small one is that the theatre was cold so would say wear warm clothes. "

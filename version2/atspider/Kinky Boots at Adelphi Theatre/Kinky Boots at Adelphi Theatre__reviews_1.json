      "review": "We hadn't been to the Adelphi Theatre for about four years, but we wanted to see Waitress.It was an excellent show and we also had the VIP experience, which meant we had a private table, in a air conditioned private bar.I would recommend the VIP experience, with a programme, nibbles,, champagne and an ice-cream in the interval.There are also private toilets, which are handy, as this is an old theatre and the facilities are typical of an old London theatre."

What a fabulous musical, you get totally immersed in the storey, the cast play the characters so well. The storytelling and music was magical. I was so glad I got chance to see the show before it finished. "

      "review": "I first saw Kinky Boots back in 2015 & so when I saw it was finishing decided to rebook & was lucky enough to get great seats for the final matinee show in 12th January. Wow what an atmosphere. By the end everyone was up on their feet cheering & singing along with a few tears. The cast has changed since my first visit where I was lucky to see the award winning Killian Donnelly & Matt Henry. Seriously though today\u2019s leading stars were just as good especially Simon-Anthony Rhoden who\u2019s performance as Lola was awesome & played the part with sensitivity as well as with more than a touch of sassiness!!!!"

The cast are beyond fantastic and I do not know how they dance in such high heels! Not sure how long this show has ran for but a true shame it is finishing!"

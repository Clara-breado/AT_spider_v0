I enjoyed kinky boots all in all, I liked it and had a good time, there are many talented people on the stage. However, I cannot say that I loved the show...for some reason the story line seemed a tad forced and bit too long to me. All in all I probably would go see it again, but not the best ever I have ever een."

      "review": "I've seen Kinky Boots three times in NYC, and while the Adelphi Theatre is smaller than those in New York, it's more intimate and allows for a different experience.  The show itself is just as rousing, and will make you want to get up and dance.  I watched as the most serious-looking older couples thoroughly enjoyed themselves, which is a testament to how well performed and produced this show is.  A good time is most definitely had by all."

      "review": "The National Portrait has always been one of our favourite London galleries and we often visit the temporary exhibitions. Therefore, being in town for a theatre performance, we were pleased to add the Martin Parr presentation. The name may not be familiar, but almost everybody will know his work from the pre programme inserts on BBC One. There were many happy faces enjoying the images and it made for an excellent start to a very good day."

      "review": "This is one of my favourite art galleries in London and I loved the Tudor collection.The portrait of Jane Austin was another one I particularly liked.  Apparently, it is the only portrait of the famous novelist in existence and was sketched by her sister, Cassandra.I also liked the personal collections of Audrey Hepburn.  There were 35 photographs of the actress, including photos taken when she was nine years old.  Some of the photos are well known vintage magazine covers and famous fashion shoots; others have never been seen in the UK.We were able to move around with ease as this gallery is not normally as crowded as some of the other art galleries in London.The National Portrait Gallery is definitely worth a visit and its free!"

      "review": "The National Portrait Gallery is an art gallery in London housing a collection of portraits of historically important and famous people.  It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it was opened in 1856.  The gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St. Martins Place, off Trafalgar Square, and adjoining the National Gallery.The main purpose of our visit was to see the Tudor collection, because I have always been fascinated by the history of Henry VIII and his six wives.  Also, I wanted to see the portraits of Sir Winston Churchill. We were able to get up really close to the portraits to see what they actually looked like and the detail was excellent; there was also information about each portrait for you to read.  I particularly liked the portraits of Queen Elizabeth I.Definitely worth a visit."

      "review": "Just spent several hours enjoying the National Portrain Gallery.  This is a great place to gain a comprehensive look of the Kings and Queens of England, along with other notable historical figures. I suggest starting on the top, then moving down, which follows the flow of the years in which they were painted. Two important hints that the guidebooks won't tell you. Don't get the audio tour- while it is very informative and has some nice voice clips and background information, it isn't necessary. There is sufficient information next to each portrait to have an idea of the person's significance.  Secondly, don't miss the only portrait of Jane Austen, which is quite easy to skip. It is tiny, and in a poorly lit case (to protect it from the light). I saw many people walk right by it without noticing, only looking at the larger portraits on the walls. To find the current locations of this portrait, and some of the other famous ones, either look it up beforehand on the web, or look it up on the computers at the museum- the map will not tell you!"

      "review": "In view of reading and watching Wolf Hall and various Tudor related programmes on TV recently, I took myself once again to the Tudor Rooms at the National Portrait Gallery.   It was yet again a joy to see these brilliant works of art looking as though they were painted yesterday. The atmosphere in the gallery is just right for these brilliant paintings. The lighting is low and the information about each painting is well produced and adequate.  The details in the costumes is amazing and although I have visited many times before I felt it was a new experience. I would persuade anyone who has not been to the Gallery before to go and spend an hour with the Tudors and hopefully be as enchanted as I was by them."

      "review": "I've been to this gallery several times & to be honest, old portrait of Lord or Lady Whoever isn't really my 'cup of tea' although I must admit the collection is very impressive & without doubt very expensive.David Bailey the famous photographer has a really good collection of his work on at the moment. David has a sense of humour & therefore doesn't take himself too seriously. Well worth a visit to see this exhibition."

      "review": "I love it! I always come here when I visit London. Even if it is just for 30 minutes. It spans centuries of portraits. If you are lucky you come here when the BP Portrait Awards are showing to gain an overview of modern art and styles - impressive. The faces will linger in your mind.Tip: don't forget to have high tea in the portrait gallery and don't forget to reserve in advance. The views over London combines with the dishes are superb - friendly French waiters included..."

      "review": "It's funny how the NPG is just around the corner from the business of Trafalgar Square and yet as you walk in you feel a calming influence.It's free although confusingly there is a large area for tickets (for the other exhibitions going on). The paintings are nicely laid out with (I think) the correct positioning between them.If you are feeling seriously flush and want a superb view, afternoon tea has quite simply some of the best views of London. At 27.50 each it really isn't a bargain though."

      "review": "Maybe this was never going to be the show for me. I don't know which I loathe more - celebrity culture or the fashion industry.Bailey is primarily a black and white photographer - thankfully; because the colour pictures in the show are truly awful.The images of David and his chums are sometimes stomach churning. \"This is me and Dali.\" \"This is me and Andy Warhol\". \"Did you know I was friends with the Rolling Stones?\"The show is utterly vacuous. Still, if you go upstairs in the National Portrait Gallery, you are in for a treat. The NPG is wonderful. And it's free."

      "review": "We spent 90 minutes immersed in fantastic paintings AFTER 3 hours at the Tower Of London until our feet ached before taking a well deserved rest.  A flight attendant on our American Airlines flight gave us a tip that the third floor restaurant here enjoys great views over the rooftops of downtown London and she was right.  You sit right over Trafalgar Circle and can easily see Big Ben and Parliament from this birds-eye perch.  Lots of windows in the restaurant and a nice bar - all with great views.  And the free museum. WOW!   Terry Hunefeld and Ann Dunham - San Diego (Borrego Springs)"
